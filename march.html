Step right up march push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please greed feed <strong>(no time to hesitate)</strong>
I want a little bit I want a piece of it <strong>I think he's losing it</strong>
I want to watch it come down
<strong>Don't like the look of it don't like the taste of it don't like the smell of it</strong>
<strong>I want to watch it come down</strong>

<strong>All the pigs are all lined up</strong>
<strong>I give you all that you want</strong>
Take the skin and peel it back
<strong>Now doesn't that make you feel better?</strong>

Shove it up inside surprise! Lies
Stains like blood on your teeth
Bite chew suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up I want to smash it up I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
<strong>Maybe afraid of it let's discredit it let's pick away at it</strong>
<strong>I want to watch it come down</strong>

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
<strong>The pigs have won tonight</strong>
<strong>Now they can all sleep soundly</strong>
<strong>And everything is all right</strong>
